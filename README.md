# ValveMultitool

ValveMultitool is a multipurpose library developed by the Chaos Initiative team. It can interoperate with and parse a wide range of Valve, Steam and Source datamodels such as GameStats Chunk & Lump, Binary VDF, VPC, INF and more. It is used by many projects including CSERServer and the Chaos applications.

This repository is a mirror of the one on the internal DevOps server, and as such, is readonly. If you would like to contribute, please submit a pull request or open an issue. Due to how the CI system works, and because the repo is readonly, we do not directly merge pull requests, they are integrated manually in DevOps.
